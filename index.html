        <p>I have loved jazz and other improvisational styles of music for most of my life – the only problem is, I never put in the time to learn how to improvise fluently over key changes. Thus, I wanted to create an instrument that would allow me to do
            so.
        </p>
        <p>My goal was to create a musical instrument using an Arduino and Pure Data (later Max/MSP) that could have full control over a background track, supporting the main function: an autotuning theremin that would map to notes belonging to the current
            chord playing in the background.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, I wanted a device that allowed the user to improvise over chord changes without having to think about which notes to play – all that would be needed is any random or deliberate hand movements in front of an ultrasonic sensor, and any
            notes produced would always sound good in the context.</p>
        <p>I wanted this device to have the following features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Autotuning Ultrasonic Theremin</li>
            <li>Pitch Bend control</li>
            <li>Transposition control</li>
            <li>+1 octave toggle</li>
            <li>Tempo control</li>
            <li>Volume control</li>
            <li>Voice selection</li>
            <li>Playback start/stop</li>
            <li>Song Select</li>
            <li>User Interface (via LCD)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All control over this device would be handled through Arduino sensors.</p>
        <p>By working towards this goal, I hoped to further my proficiency and appreciation of Arduino and basic circuitry, as well as proficiency in Pure Data (later Max/MSP.)</p>
        <p>Overshadowing all this, however, was the ultimate goal to have fun and create something fun to play with.</p>

        <h3 class="py-3">Pure Data and Max/MSP</h3>

        <p>Initially, I did not own Max/MSP, so I began my journey using Pure Data.</p>
        <p>The first thing I thought of was how I wanted to play the background track. Initially, I considered the option of importing a midi file and reading it. However, I realized the greatest challenge with reading a midi file was that I could not control
            the timing easily; I was also imagining being able to control the eighth note swing amount, and I could not find any object in Pure Data that allowed me to control the timing of individual events from a midi file during playback. Further,
            after testing playback of some midi files, I realized that playback by the seq object played the midi files at a slower bpm than it should have. This would have made synchronizing theremin note-mapping behavior to the background track extremely
            difficult. One massive advantage of hard-coding my looping background tracks, I realized, was that I could easily ensure that the theremin notes were always in the same chord as what was being played. Thus, I decided to hard-code my own background
            tracks.
        </p>
        <p>Because of this rather long process, I only coded two background tracks: One called Mas O Menos, a composition by my high school band teacher that I recreated from memory, and Jammin by Bob Marley.</p>
        <p>I created patches for each of the background tracks for the two songs, as well as patches for the note-mapping. I planned for the theremin to be able to control a range of 13 notes at any time, so note messages would simply be received in Max/MSP
            as numbers 1-13 (13 is the highest note). Then, depending on the chord, that number would be mapped to some note in the chord that was currently playing (as signaled by the background track patch – this way the theremin mapping was always
            guaranteed to be in the same chord as the background).</p>
        <p>I managed to implement a control over the amount of delay in the eighth note swing feel in Jammin by simply delaying every odd beat number given by the tempo object, which contributed massively to its enjoyability.</p>
        <p>Then I created the signal processing patch that would receive the signals from the serial port sent by Arduino, and send them to the appropriate looping background music patches.</p>
        <p>At this point, I decided to purchase a Max license, to my wallet’s dismay. Thankfully, Max/MSP could interpret Pure Data patch files, so transferring my work was very simple; I just had to change the objects that were named differently.</p>
        <p>I had complete control over what kind of messages to write and read from the serial port, so for fun, I largely invented my own message protocol (for example, {69 127 0} would be a pitch bend message). All the signal messages are detailed in the
            main max patch.</p>
        <p>After implementing how all the messages would be interpreted and routed to the correct objects to control the backing track, I was ready to begin wiring and coding with Arduino.</p>

        <h3 class="py-3">Arduino</h3>

        <p>I was faced with one major challenge – I wanted to implement about 15 unique functions, but I only had 7 sensors in total. Thus, I thought to combine sensor inputs. The 4 buttons change functions when the joystick is pushed and held in certain
            directions (see user manual for function mapping).</p>
        <p>The ultrasonic sensor was set up so that note n would play when the ultrasonic sensor value (cmDistance) was within boundaries set by:</p>
        <blockquote class="blockquote row text-center">
            <p class="p-3 mx-auto">Upper bound = (16-n) * [noteGap]</p>
            <p class="p-3 mx-auto">Lower bound = (15-n) * [noteGap]</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Where [noteGap] is a variable controlling the size of the note “windows”. I decided to omit the first 2 multiples of noteGap to the note mapping, because at that distance (the closest distances) it was exceptionally inconsistent.
        </p>
        <p>I found that the ultrasonic sensor would return distance values very inconsistently overall, mapping to different notes even when holding your hand still. The inconsistency of the ultrasonic sensor cripples the playability of the instrument, so
            I thought of three ways to mitigate this effect.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To increase the size of noteGap (while not making the lowest note too far away; the inconsistency of the sensor values increases over distance).</li>
            <li>To take the median value (to omit high-variance outliers, which occur frequently) of every 4 or 5 sensor values returned (the number to average should be kept minimal to maximize responsiveness)</li>
            <li>To code it such that the note window of the current note playing would be larger than all the others, such that you must move your hand some distance PAST the normal boundary for the note to change. I refer to this as “dynamic mapping”.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Dynamic mapping was rather complicated for me. I made it such that a note would only play if either the currently playing note were NOT adjacent to it; or, if the currently playing note was right next to it, then I would give it new window boundary
            conditions. After it was implemented, there was a noticeable improvement in sensor consistency.</p>
        <p>One crucial thing I had to remember was that no block of code in the Arduino should cause any sort of delay; it should be sensing and interpreting user inputs as quickly as possible, looping the code as fast as possible. This meant that buttons
            must only send one signal every time they are pushed and held; otherwise, for example, a pushing of a “tempo up” button for 50 iterations of the Arduino loop would speed up the tempo by 50 times.
        </p>
        <p>The LCD was also a challenge to work with since I only had 32 characters to work with. I managed to display all the relevant information by abbreviating things. Further, most resources on the internet strongly suggest that the V0 pin of the LCD
            (controlling contrast) should be controlled with a potentiometer, but my potentiometer was reserved for volume control, and after extensive testing I settled on a 5.1 kΩ resistor instead.</p>
        <p>After all this, the biggest and most tedious challenge was to ensure that no sensors and their conditions interfered with anything else. This consisted of a long process of troubleshooting. When something didn’t work properly, I isolated only
            the code relevant to one or some specific combination of sensors in a separate Arduino sketch to test them. After arduous testing, I had a functional AUTIA.</p>

        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>The ultrasonic sensor is still very jittery; notes change erratically and make deliberate rhythms difficult to execute.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, the note-off signals don’t work.</li>
            <li>It needs to be physically connected to a computer to work. Perhaps in a future version I could send the info wirelessly through Open Sound Control.</li>
            <li>The wires are a complete eyesore and it’s horrendously ugly and user-unfriendly.</li>
            <li>The code is not optimized and runs probably extremely inefficiently, both max and Arduino.</li>
            <li>Volume changes are only triggered when a note is triggered.</li>
            <li>Ideally, Max would have a way to communicate to Arduino so that the information between then could always update together, but I never got that working. As of now, information in the Arduino stored for LCD printing is always independently
                managed from the information in Max.</li>
            <li>The bend sensor doesn’t sound good. You can hear the quantization of the pitch, so next time I would try to interpret it to the maximum resolution (least significant bit AND most significant bit).</li>
            <li>You must hard-code any songs you wish to improvise over.</li>

        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>The bend sensor currently only sends the MSB data, which means it will only support pitch steps 1/128 of the frequencies between the current note and the higher note. I could set it up to send both MSB and LSB, such that it sends a range of
                0 to 16,383 increments to the next tone instead of just 128.</li>
            <li>The long, loose wires could be replaced by firmer wires that hold shape, such that hiding the wiring would be possible. This would allow me to redesign the wiring to make the entire instrument more user-friendly.
            </li>
            <li>I would probably replace the flex sensor with something more controllable and consistent, like a joystick. It is currently not performing well.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Overall, this was an exceptionally enlightening project that certainly allowed me to further appreciate the software and hardware required to create a MIDI instrument. I have come to understand Arduino and Max/MSP much better, and had fun in the
            process. I was exceptionally proud of the combined sensor inputs for additional control options as well as the dynamic mapping implemented to improve the ultrasonic sensor’s consistency.</p>
        <p>It is far from perfect, and if I were further motivated and had the time, I could improve this device; as of now, it is simply a proof of concept – a prototype.</p>

        <p>Upload the Arduino code to the Arduino. Take note of the port that it occupies.</p>
        <p>Open the Max patch and open the main patch, MUMT PROJECT V2.</p>
        <p>Ensure the message object at the top-left of the patch (called port COM24 from development) names the correct port being used, as in (port [portname here]).</p>
        <p>Then you can simply click the “start program” button at the top.</p>
        <p>Note that there may be a few seconds of latency between pressing B and the song actually starting.</p>
